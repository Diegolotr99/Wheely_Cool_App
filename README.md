# Wheely Cool App

This is an Android app using:
Kotlin, Clean Architecture, Room Database, Dagger Hilt, Flow, View Models, ViewBinding. 
This implementation contains a small lite version of the known library [LuckyWheel](https://github.com/thanhniencung/LuckyWheel), that library was used as reference
to make the spin wheel custom view behavior, but we removed all the advanced features and not needed code for this sample app, also all code used was ported from Java to Kotlin
